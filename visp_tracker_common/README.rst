Introduction
============

The ``visp_tracker_common`` is a package that contains:

  - base classes for the different ViSP's tracker nodes, providing a common interface,
  - messages used by these nodes,
  - a ``tracker_gui`` node, that permits to display the tracking results on a machine different from
    the one that runs the tracker.

Prerequisities
==============

Install ROS 2
-------------

Make sure your ROS 2 core environment is installed. Refer to the official
`ROS 2 documentation <https://docs.ros.org/>`__ to get started.

Install ViSP
------------

Please refer to the official installation instructions from the
`ViSP installation tutorials <https://visp-doc.inria.fr/doxygen/visp-daily/tutorial_install.html>`__.

.. Note::

  * Pre-built ViSP packages exist for Ubuntu (`libvisp-dev`) and ROS 2 (`ros2-<distro>-visp`), but they are usually
    built against a reduced number of third-party libraries. Consequently, you might miss advanced features required
    to control hardware (e.g., Franka robots), acquire images from RealSense cameras, or leverage the Panda3D
    dependency needed for the `visp_rbt` package.
  * That's why **we strongly recommend building ViSP from source.**
    See `tutorials <https://visp-doc.inria.fr/doxygen/visp-daily/tutorial_install_src.html>`__.
  * After building ViSP from source, remember to set the `VISP_DIR` environment variable to your build directory,
    for example:

    .. code-block:: shell

      export VISP_DIR=$VISP_WS/visp-build


How to get and build visp_tracker_common
========================================

Here we suppose that you have a ROS 2  workspace in ``~/colcon_ws/`` folder.

  * Clone the repository into your workspace source directory, checking out the branch corresponding to your
    ROS distribution:

    .. code-block:: shell

      cd ~/colcon_ws/src
      git clone -b $ROS_DISTRO https://github.com/lagadic/visp_tk.git
      cd ..

  * Install required ROS 2 dependencies via ``rosdep``:

    .. code-block:: shell

      rosdep update && rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src

  * Build the ``visp_tracker_common`` package:

    .. code-block:: shell

      colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to visp_tracker_common

    .. Note::

      If you encounter the following issue:

        .. code-block:: shell

          --- stderr: visp_tracker_common
          CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:46 (find_package):
            By not providing "FindVISP.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
            asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "VISP", but
            CMake did not find one.

            Could not find a package configuration file provided by "VISP" (requested
            version 3.7) with any of the following names:

              VISPConfig.cmake
              visp-config.cmake

            Add the installation prefix of "VISP" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
            "VISP_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "VISP"
            provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
            installed.

      it means tha ViSP is not found. Use ``VISP_DIR`` to point to ``$VISP_WS/visp-build`` folder like:

        .. code-block:: shell

          colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to visp_common --cmake-args -DVISP_DIR=$VISP_WS/visp-build


BaseTracker node
================

This section will present the different parameters of the :cpp:class:`visp_tracker_common::BaseTracker` class.

Related to subscription / publication
-------------------------------------

* **REQUIRED** ``rgb_camera_info_topic_name``: name of the color camera topic.
* **REQUIRED** ``rgb_image_topic_name``: name of the color image topic.

Related to the tracking
-----------------------

* *OPTIONAL* ``config_file``: path to the configuration file to initialize the tracker. package:// will be replaced by the path to the share folder of the corresponding package.
* *OPTIONAL* ``init_method``: initialization method to initialize the tracker. Default method is initialization by click.
* *OPTIONAL* ``init_topic``: if the ``init_method`` is set to topic, this parameter becomes **REQUIRED** and must be set to the topic of type ``geometry_msgs:msg::PoseStamped`` the tracker must use to get the init pose.

Related to the display
----------------------

* *OPTIONAL* ``headless_mode``: if set to true, the node will not display anything. A TrackerGUI node will be needed in
  addition to the tracker node.
* *OPTIONAL* ``display_nb_frames_skipped``: if ``headless_mode`` is set to false, this parameter indicates the number of frames skipped during display.

BaseMultiModalTracker node
==========================

This section will present the different parameters of the :cpp:class:`visp_tracker_common::BaseMultiModalTracker` class.
The node will determine if it requires depth or not depending on the tracker configuration. If the node
requires depth, the ``depth_camera_info_topic_name`` and ``depth_image_topic_name`` becomes **REQUIRED**.
If the tracker requires depth, a `message_filters::Synchronizer <https://github.com/ros2/message_filters/blob/rolling/doc/index.rst>`__
is used to temporally synchronize the depth stream and the color stream. **NB**: using the ``TrackerGUI`` class
on the same computer than a class inheriting from :cpp:class:`visp_tracker_common::BaseMultiModalTracker` and using depth
leads to the freezing of the tracker, due to a desynchronization of the color and depth streams.

Related to subscription / publication
-------------------------------------

* *OPTIONAL* ``depth_camera_info_topic_name``: name of the depth camera topic.
* *OPTIONAL* ``depth_image_topic_name``: name of the depth stream topic.
* *OPTIONAL* ``stream_qos_durability``: the durability of both the RGB and depth image streams (they need to be the same) if depth is required.
* *OPTIONAL* ``stream_qos_reliability``: the reliability of both the RGB and depth image streams (they need to be the same) if depth is required.
* *OPTIONAL* ``stream_qos_depth``: the depth of the queue of both the RGB and depth image streams (they need to be the same) if depth is required.

Related to the tracking
-----------------------

* *OPTIONAL* ``z_factor``: factor to convert the depth image expressed as uint16_t into meters. For instance, if a value
  of ``1000`` in the raw depth image corresponds to ``1 meter``, the ``z_factor`` must be set to ``0.001``.

``tracker_gui`` node
====================

This section will present the different parameters of the ``tracker_gui`` node. This node permits to
have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) on a remote computer, i.e. on another computer than the one that is running the tracker node(s). It should not
be used when you can run the tracker on a computer that has actual display capabilities, especialy with mulimodal trackers,
because it makes out of synchronization the RGB and depth streams, freezing the tracker.

* *OPTIONAL* ``image_transport``: the type of image transport compression algorithm used. Default is ``compressed``. See `image_transport_plugins <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_transport_plugins>`__ for more information.
* **REQUIRED** ``camera_topic``: the name of the camera information topic of the RGB stream.
* **REQUIRED** ``color_topic``: the name of the raw RGB stream (e.g. ``/camera/color/image_raw``). The ``image_transport`` parameter will then be used to determine the sub topic that will be used.
* *OPTIONAL* ``color_qos_queue_depth``: the depth of the queue of the RGB topic.
* *OPTIONAL* ``color_qos_durability``: the durability of the messages of the RGB topic.
* *OPTIONAL* ``color_qos_reliability``: the reliability of the messages of the RGB topic.

* *OPTIONAL* ``depth_topic``: the name of the raw depth stream (e.g. ``/camera/depth/image_raw``). The ``image_transport`` subscriber will then subscribe to the ``compressedDepth`` sub-topic.
* *OPTIONAL* ``depth_qos_queue_depth``: the depth of the queue of the depth topic.
* *OPTIONAL* ``depth_qos_durability``: the durability of the messages of the depth topic.
* *OPTIONAL* ``depth_qos_reliability``: the reliability of the messages of the depth topic.

Related to display
------------------

* *OPTIONAL* ``poses_names``: a vector of strings. Each item corresponds to the name to display beside the message that comes from the topic listed ``poses_topics`` which has
  the same index than the item. **Important**: must have the same size than ``poses_topics``.
* *OPTIONAL* ``depth_scale``: the scale to transform the raw depth image into a depth image expressed in meters. (e.g. if the raw depth image is encoded such as ``1000`` corresponds to ``1m``, the parameter must be set to ``0.001``).
* *OPTIONAL* ``min_depth``: the minimum depth to display, in meters.
* *OPTIONAL* ``max_depth``: the maximum depth to display, in meters.
* *OPTIONAL* ``features_thickness``: the thickness of the features published in the ``features_topics``, in pixels.
